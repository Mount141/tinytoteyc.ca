        <p>Hi, My name is Pam Barrett and I have been in the Early Childhood field for 35 years and  employed with Tiny Tot Early Years Centre for the past 26 years. I have a diploma in Early Childhood Education from Holland College.

I am currently enrolled with UNB in the Bachelor Of Education in Early Childhood Degree Program.
I hosted a school-age workshop titled “Too Cool for Daycare” in November 2011 for educators who were involved in after school care.  I currently live in the Charlottetown area  and have two children and two grandchildren.</p>

        <h3>Jacenta Clark – Director of Tiny Tot Early Years (Pope Avenue)</h3>
        <p>My name is Jacenta Clark, and I am from Vernon River Prince Edward Island. I am excited to join the Educators and Staff and Tiny Tot (Pope) EYC.
I have lived and worked all over Canada as an Early Childhood Educator for 20 years. I received my Diploma from Nova Scotia College of Early Childhood Education and have studied in Music, Arts and Literature as well. I have 3 children of my own who are all teenagers and one forever
toddler (my chihuahua). I have always been passionate about Early Childhood Education especially for children in their Early Years of Development.

On my own time I really enjoy reading, IT Technology, working on my hobby farm, spending time outside in thegarden or at the beach and creative art projects. I also really enjoy cooking and baking. I look forward to getting to know you and your child and all the staff at this centre as we embark on this adventure of community together!

Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost….”

        <h3>Georgia Driscoll – Director of Rainbow Early Years (Summerside)</h3>
        <p>I’m Georgia Driscoll and I’m the Director at Rainbow Early Years. I am passionate about developmentally appropriate practices, emotional regulation, inclusion, and early music education. I was born in Bath, England; raised in Geneva, Switzerland; and spent my teenage years in Fall River, Nova Scotia. I graduated from Acadia University in 2018 with a Bachelor of Music Therapy and moved to the Island that same year. I worked as a music therapist for several years and began my ECE career at Island Montessori Academy, as a special needs assistant. I attained my Level 3 certification through Holland College’s Accelerated Program. Life soon moved us up west, and I worked at Yuill Learn and Grow Daycare before becoming the Director here at Rainbow.

Outside of work, I sing with Luminos Ensemble, teach private music lessons, and coach horseback riding. My spare time is spent with my horse Mya, cuddling with our two cats Trooper and Arya, and going for adventures with our dog, Cito. I also value spending time with my soon-to-be husband, James, and our friends and family.</p>

        <h3>Dorraine Arsenault – Director of The Mount Playtime Daycare Centre</h3>
        <p>My name is Dorraine Arsenault.
I have been the Director of The Mount Playtime Daycare Centre  for just over five years.
Previous to that, I was Owner/Director of Playtime Daycare Centre in East Royalty for thirty seven years.  During that time, I experienced the many aspects of owning and operating a small business, interacting with pre-school age children of all ages and seeing their families grow through the stages of life.
I received my Diploma in Early Childhood Education at Holland College and continue to attend workshops and courses as a way of keeping up with the ever changing trends in the field of Early Childhood Education.
Becoming part of The Mount Continuing Care Community has been a rewarding and learning experience for both myself and the children.  Seeing the interaction between the residents and the children always brings a smile to my face.
I live in St.Catherines with my husband and my dog Cooper. I enjoy spending time with my adult children and my grand-daughter Ava.</p>
